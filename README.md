# kevin-bacon-bfs
program inspired by coding train bfs video..
so the idea is to create a graph where nodes are name of actors and movies, but there is no edge between two actor node they can only be connected via movie node.
since kevin bacon is popular actor chances are he is most of the movies and eventually we will find a common movie node between him and any other actor
